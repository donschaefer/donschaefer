Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

### `npm run preview`

## Testing

- All tests are now run using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), which is Jest-compatible for most syntax and assertions.
- Test files are located in `src/tests/unitTests/` and use `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions.
- To run tests, use `npm test` or `npx vitest`.
